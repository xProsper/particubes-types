`BlockProperties` describes possible properties for a [Block].

In most cases, [BlockProperties] are `readOnly`.

Except entries in [Config.MapPaletteOverrides](/reference/config#property-mappaletteoverrides), to override map block properties for a game.

[BlockProperties] in [Map.LocalPalette](/reference/map#property-localpalette) can also be set at any time as long as the block is opaque and not light emissive.
