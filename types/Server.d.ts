The `Server` acts as a host and director for the game.

For example, if your game requires a minimum amount of players, it's a good idea to use the [Server] to count and trigger game start.

⚠️ Multiplayer has been turned off in the first beta versions. It will be back soon, and this page will be updated with more details.
