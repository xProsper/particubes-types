# Unofficial Typescript types definition for Particubes
Outputs Particubes.d.ts from [Particubes lua docs](https://github.com/voxowl/particubes/tree/master/lua-docs/content/reference) YML files

# What is this for ?
Given at this moment in time, particubes is in alpha and the only way to code levels is via one single lua script with in-game feature-free editor, I decided to create this project that generates Typescript types from the lua docs of the project.

Upon looking for a better way to code a Particubes project I stumbled upon this library [TypescriptToLua](https://typescripttolua.github.io) which can transpile a typescript project down to a single lua script.

Now in order to have auto completion for the Particubes specific code, a typescript DTS file was necessary.
