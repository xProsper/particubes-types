/**
Pointer is a shortcut to [Client].[Pointer].

Pointer allows to catch user pointer events. Mouse events or touch events depending on the device.

The goal is to create an abstraction for world inputs to work on any platform. A world that's been developped on PC should work great on mobile, and the developer shouldn't have to worry about this.
