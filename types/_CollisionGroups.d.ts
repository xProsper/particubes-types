`CollisionGroups` represents an [array] of collision group numbers.

Collision groups are used to define how objects in the world collide with each others.

Group numbers go from `1` to `8`. The [Map] by default is in group `1`, and by default, all [Object]s collide with that group, but that behavior can be changed.
