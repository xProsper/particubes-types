/**
An `Object` is the most basic thing that can be added to the game 3D scene.

It has a position, a rotation and a scale and can contain child [Object]s, including [Object] extensions like [Shape].

An object by itself does not render anything on screen, but it can contain [Shape]s and thus become a parent coordinate system for them.

An `Object` can also take part in the physics simulation when setting [Object.Physics](#property-physics) to `true`.
